## Before you code


### 1. Take a look at the description and code in bowling.js, as well as the tests in bowling-test.js


### 2. Rewrite the problem in your own words:


### 3. What are your initial thoughts about this problem? (2-3 sentences)


### 4. Write out a few lines of initial pseudocode within your totalScore function (this should be short, and not be real code!)
